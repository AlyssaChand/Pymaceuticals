Pymaceuticals

The pymaceuticals code is created to generate the tables and figures needed for the technical report of the clinical study. I used the following sources to help write the code: pandas.pydata.org, matplotlib.org, docs.scipy.org, google, bing, and BCS by watching our cloud recordings and revisiting our class activities.
